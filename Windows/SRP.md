Description
-----------

Pure, unmitigated awesomeness. They allow you to restrict which types of
files are allowed to run and where they are allowed to run from.

Basically, you restrict programs to execute from the Windows and Program
Files directories. Believe it or not, this stops most drive-by attacks.
In fact, we find it to be far more effective than traditional black-list
AV.
