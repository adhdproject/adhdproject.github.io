WWHF 2020 ADHD Labs
----------------------
Howdy folks! Welcome to the Wild West Hackin' Fest ADHD labs! We have some new
things for you to play with, so stick around and let's get to it!

First, these labs are brand new. We wrote them based off the labs you can find
in the documentation for the official ADHD release here: [adhdproject.github.io](https://adhdproject.github.io)

The documentation contains setup, install, and usage instructions for all of the
tools included in ADHD. If you run into trouble, this might help you out!

Here are the tools we've created labs for so far:
- [Canary Tokens](CanaryTokens_WWHF2020_Deadwood.md)
- [Cowrie](Cowrie_WWHF2020_Deadwood.md)
- [HoneyBadger](HoneyBadger_WWHF2020_Deadwood.md)
- [Portspoof](Portspoof_WWHF2020_Deadwood.md)
- [PSAD](PSAD_WWHF2020_Deadwood.md)

The nature of these labs has you use these tools to analyze attacks that were
carried out against the lab Virtual Machine. Each tool will have you analyze a
few different scenarios or complete a small challenge. There are a few flags
hidden within each scenario. These signify the completion of the lab. For those
participating in the WWHF CTF, this is how you can get the flags for the ADHD
portion of the lab.

**Bonus Points?!?!**

If you have an idea for ADHD that consists of an awesome new tool, a
quality-of-life improvement, or general suggestions, we'd love to hear it!
If your idea is super awesome, we may be able to get you some bonus points
towards the CTF. Just be sure to mention @moth or @martianjay on discord.

**COVID-19**

We know COVID-19 sucks, and we'd much rather get to hang out with you all in
person. We had planned to simulate real time attacks, setup honey pots, and
cause havoc for an attacker, but we couldn't come up with a reliable way to set
this up for a virtual conference. We are planning on using these labs as
building blocks for the future, so hopefully we'll be hacking the
attackers together in conferences in the near future.
